# Major Keys 
A game created by Rashaunda Guy-Callum

Overview

A DJ Khaled inspired hip-hop trivia game for the "true" Hip Hop Head. The object of Major Keys is to get DJ Khaled's "Keys" of wisdom by answering trivia questions to advance your character closer to his Major Key. If your answer is correct, you collect a key, hear one of DJ Khaled's motivational words (keys) of wisdom, and run closer to him. Each correct word is worth 1000 points and 1 key. Answer incorrectly, and you lose keys, points and DJ Khaled roasts you. To win the game, you need to have at least 3 keys by the end of the game. Score less than 3 keys by the end of the game and you lose! Scoring below -3000 at any point in the game and its GAME OVER!"

I did a lot of editing in Photoshop to create and color characters, edit background photo and edit downloaded gifs as well as final cut pro to edit audio. The Dj khaled gif alone was time consuming as it came with a white background that I had to delete the background for 21 images and then re-export as a gif. My Javascript is pretty simple with if/else statements and set interval to create the illusion of the character running towards DJ Khaled for a correct answer. I'm really proud of my Javascript as I came up with it on my own. I know my Javascript can be even more dry with a for loop, however I was having a little trouble with my arrays, so I switched to what I know, a long a$$ if/else statement! lol. Making this game was awesome, and allowed me to challenge myself. Special shoutout to Nyemah Crippen who drew the female character. Enjoy the game!!
