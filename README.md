# Major Keys 
A game created by Rashaunda Guy-Callum

Overview

A combination of the classic hangman game and hip-hop trivia. The object of Major Keys is to get keys from DJ Khaled by answering 5 trivia questions in each round to advance your character toward DJ Khaled. If the word typed in the box is correct the character collects a key, hears one of DJ Khaled's motivational words(keys) of wisdom, and runs closer to him. Each correct word is worth 1000 points and 1 key. If the word is incorrect, the character stays in place and doesn't get any points or motivational keys from DJ Khaled. To win the game, the player has to have at least 3 questions correct by the end of the game. Score less than 3 by the end of the game and you lose! Score below -3 at any point in the game and its GAME OVER!  

I did a lot of editing in Photoshop to create and color characters, edit background photo and edit downloaded gifs as well as final cut pro to edit audio. The Dj khaled gif alone was time consuming as it came with a white background that I had to delete the background for 21 images and then re-export as a gif. My Javascript is pretty simple with if/else statements and set interval to create the illusion of the character running towards DJ Khaled for a correct answer. I'm really proud of my Javascript as I came up with it on my own. I know my Javascript can be even more dry with a for loop, however I was having a little trouble with my arrays, so I switched to what I know, a long a$$ if/else statement! lol. Making this game was awesome, and allowed me to challenge myself. Special shoutout to Nyemah Crippen who drew the female character. Enjoy the game!!
